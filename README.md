# fencepoint
app that tracks your practice fencing matches irl and provides data using your camera or a rc car on how to get better, tips etc and what you are doing correctly

i'm building a rc car to go with this! using an ESP32, motor driver, ultrasonic sensors, and an ESP32-CAM, powered by a rechargeable battery and controlled through a bluetooth-connected react app (this repo). The car can be manually driven from the app, follow a person automatically using distance sensors, and record practice video with its onboard camera 📸!!
